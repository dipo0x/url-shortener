Ensure that you have Golang, Postgresql and RabbitMQ installed on your machine. Alternatively, you can use their cloud service.

Navigate to the root directory of the project in a terminal.

```bash
cd url-shortener
```

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies

```bash
go install
```

After that, run this command to create a .env file with which you can get started with.

```bash
bash build/scripts/setup.sh
```
